I am an assistant professor at the Institute of Physics, NCU in Poland.

My research focuses on the development of enhanced sampling methods for 
studying the long-time behavior of physical systems.

Some of my recent interests include:
* Learning collective variables for enhanced sampling methods;
* Representation learning with physical meaning;
* Rare events in biophysical processes.
